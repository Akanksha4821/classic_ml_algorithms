# classic_ml_algorithms
My learning journey through classic ML algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more — explained with clean code 
This repository contains beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebooks implementing foundational machine learning algorithms using Python and scikit-learn.

## ✅ Current Notebooks

- **[Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression](cancer_classification_logistic.ipynb)**  
  Binary classification of tumor data using logistic regression.  
  📁 **Dataset used**: [`data/cancer.csv`](data/cancer.csv)  
  📌 Predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using diagnostic features.

- **[KNN Classification with 3 Features](knn_3_features.ipynb)**  
  Applied K-Nearest Neighbors to classify purchase behavior based on 3 input features.  
  📁 **Dataset used**: [`data/Purchase_Logistic.csv`](data/Purchase_Logistic.csv)
  🔍 Includes feature scaling, KNN training, evaluation, and visualizations 

- **[Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression](logistic_regression_titanic.ipynb)**  
  Classification of Titanic passengers to predict survival using logistic regression.  
  📁 **Dataset used**: [`data/titanic (1).csv`](data/titanic%20(1).csv)  
  ⚙️ Includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding), model training, and accuracy evaluation

- **[Salary Prediction using Linear Regression](linear_regression_salary.ipynb)**  
  A simple linear regression model that predicts salary based on years of experience.  
  📁 **Dataset used**: [`data/Salary_Data.csv`](data/Salary_Data.csv)  
  📈 Covers visualization, model training, prediction, and regression line plotting — with clear beginner-level guidance.
